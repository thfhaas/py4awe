The package py4awe was created to help reading and processing the outputs of the optimization toolbox AWEbox. 
The file "example/main.py" shows a few examples on how to use py4awe.
The file "example/verify_aero_implementation.py" focuses on the verification of the aero model, in particular frame transformations and sign conventions.
